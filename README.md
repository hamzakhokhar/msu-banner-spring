MSU Banner Project

Team 3:

This project is the MSU Banner assignment for Software Development Methods and Tools course. 
This project was completed by team 3 using the Scrum development method. 

For this project we chose not to care which IDE that the members will be using. IntelliJ and Eclipse are the IDE's that we have decided to use with an even split between the two. 

We have chosen to rotate the responsibilities of Scrum Master and Product owner every sprint and will all be acting as developers. 

We will be using Scrum on Trello as our management system to assign tasks and to stay on schedule with what our customer is requiring. 

We will be using Slack as our primary form of communication, but we also have Discord and email available as needed.
